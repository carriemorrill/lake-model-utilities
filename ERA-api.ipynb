    "# Using Climate Data Store API to access ERA5 reanalysis  \n",
    "## Steps (for Windows):  \n",
    "1. Set up account at: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home (button on top right)   \n",
    "2. From your user profile (click on your name near Logout button on top right) find the API key information -- both the UID and API key.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Create a file named .cdsapirc (making a dot file on Windows can be tricky, see instructions links here: https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+install+and+use+CDS+API+on+Windows). Put three lines of information looking like this into .cdsapirc:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    url: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/v2  \n",
    "    key: insert_your_UID_here : insert_your_API_key_here  \n",
    "    verify: 0  \n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "4. Put the .cdsapirc file in your home directory (e.g., C:\\Users\\carrie.morrill). \n",
    "  \n",
    "5. Install CDS API. E.g., in Anaconda prompt: conda install -c conda-forge cdsapi  \n",
    "  \n",
    "6. From the Climate Data Store find the dataset and data you would like (e.g., https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=form) and then click button \"Show API request\" at bottom of page. Copy and paste the API request provided into new notebook cell below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Note: The API will by default return all grid cell values (global).  To select a latitude-longitude box, use the area selection as shown in the notebook cell below.  For netcdf output, the grid cells are at 0.25 degree intervals.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "8. Run API request.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "9. Download results from your user account online.  \n",
